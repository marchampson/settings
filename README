This is my Vim configuration.

It is the product of many years of Vim use -- though most of the changes
have happened in three phases:

 * When I first started learning Vim in 2001/2002.
 * During my first couple of years at Zend, when I was looking for tools
   to help make me more productive.
 * Late 2010, when I started noticing a "revolution" in the Vim
   community in terms of better ways to distribute and keep plugins
   up-to-date (Vimana, Pathogen, etc.) as well as a lot of open-sourcing
   of plugins via GitHub.

There are some "oddities" that you'll find:
 
 * I've mapped "jj" to "<Esc>". This allows me to keep my fingers in the
   home row when switching modes.
 * I've moved my tags and viewfiles outside my .vim directory; these are
   transient, and I don't want to track them with Git.

For the most part, however, I've simply got a number of oft-used
plugins, and sane settings for my everyday use.

Make sure you customize the vimrc file!

Enjoy!
